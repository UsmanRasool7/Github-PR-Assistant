# Test Configuration for AI Code Review System

This file contains test configuration and examples for validating the AI code review system.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Simple Function Addition
- Add utility functions
- Test basic code analysis
- Verify embedding generation

### 2. Complex Refactoring
- Modify existing classes
- Test change detection
- Verify semantic search

### 3. Bug Fix Simulation
- Fix known issues
- Test issue identification
- Verify improvement suggestions

## Expected AI Analysis

The AI should be able to:
- ✅ Identify new utility functions
- ✅ Analyze code complexity
- ✅ Suggest improvements
- ✅ Detect code patterns
- ✅ Provide meaningful summaries

## Test Data
- Lines of Code: ~50-100
- Functions: 3-5
- Classes: 1-2
- Complexity: Low to Medium
